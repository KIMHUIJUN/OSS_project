P.R.R.W.\r\nLyrics By 윤하, James Son\r\nComposed By 윤하, JEWNO\r\nArranged By JEWNO\r\n\r\n비가역적인 시간은 끝을 향해 달려간다.\r\n주어진 시간이 흐른다라면, 기꺼이 과거를 보내고 타임라인에 맞춰 시간에 올라타겠다는 내용.\r\n일렉기타의 락킹하고 감성적인 선율이 매력적인 멜로딕 퓨처베이스 장르이며, drop에 제목을 풀어 낸 가사로 다짐을 게워낸다.\r\n\r\n07. 나는 계획이 있다\r\nLyrics By 김수지(lalala studio)\r\nComposed By JEWNO, 윤하\r\nArranged By JEWNO\r\n\r\n설레게 했던 계획의 끝에는 실행만이 남아있다. 시간이 더 지나기 전에 동료들과 실행할 것!\r\n혼자 보다 둘이, 둘 보다 많은 사람들과 함께라면 계획은 완성된다.\r\n설레는 패드사운드와 강력하고 시원한 신디사이저가 어우러진 일렉트로닉 퓨처 팝.\r\n\r\n08. Truly\r\nLyrics By 윤하\r\nComposed By 윤하\r\nArranged By JEWNO\r\n\r\n아직도 꿈을 꾸지만, 마지막 숨을 지켜줄 사람 있을까.\r\n강하게 마음을 먹어도 늘 불안하다.\r\n클린톤의 일렉기타 사운드가 염세적인 가사를 표현해 준다.\r\n점점 더 고조되는 드럼과 기타 사운드가 담긴 모던 락\r\n\r\n09. 별의 조각\r\nLyrics By 윤하\r\nComposed By 권순일\r\nArranged By JEWNO\r\n\r\n더 나은 선택이라는 게 존재할 수 있을까?\r\n맞바꾸지 못할 만큼 소중한 것이 생겨간다.\r\n모두가 별의 조각, 지구의 이방인, 그 조각들이 맞춰질 때\r\n비로소 빛을 내는 별이 되는게 아닐까.\r\n윤하의 목소리를 극대화시킨 팝 발라드 장르의 곡으로, 단 4개의 코드만으로 옥타브를 나누어 동일 반복되는 벌스, 코러스가 인상적인 곡이다.\r\n우주적 공간을 표현하기 위한 수많은 엠비언트 사운드의 트랙들은 MV버전의 인트로에서 더욱 자세히 만나볼 수 있다.\r\n\r\n10. 하나의 달 (Here)\r\nLyrics By 윤하\r\nComposed By 윤하, James Son\r\nArranged By 김동민, SHAUN\r\n\r\n닿지 못하고 만질 수 없다 해도, 바라보는 그 자체로 만족할 수 있도록 기도한다.\r\n성스러운 피아노 아르페지오 리프와 아트모스적인 기타 앰비언트 사운드가 돋보이는 곡.\r\n리듬악기가 없는 곡의 모양새가 특별하다.\r\n장장 4분 41초동안 변화해가는 스페이스 오디세이와 웅장한 오케스트레이션을 느낄 수 있는 시네마팝.\r\n\r\n11. 사건의 지평선 (Title)\r\nLyrics By 윤하\r\nComposed By 윤하, JEWNO\r\nArranged By JEWNO, SHAUN\r\n\r\n블랙홀의 경계인 사건의 지평선, 예측되지 않는 이별 그 너머의 이야기를 담았다. 좋았던 날의 안녕과 새로운 시작의 응원을 경쾌한 포크락의 톤에 얹은 모던락으로 어딘가의 아련함을 감출 수 없다. 모든 끝에 시작이 함께하기를 바라는 End Theory의 마침표가 되는 곡.\r\n\r\n12. Black hole\r\nLyrics By 윤하\r\nComposed By 윤하, JEWNO, SHAUN, SAMIN, Hardy\r\nArranged By JEWNO, SHAUN\r\n\r\n항성 진화의 최종단계로 한없이 수축하며 우주와 같은 색을 띄어 가는 블랙홀에게 별이었던 순간을 잊지 않겠다 이야기한다. 다음을 기약할 수 없는 끝에서, 영원을 기리며 기억 한 편에 새겨내는 퓨처베이스 팝.\r\n\r\n13. Savior\r\nLyrics By 윤하, James Son\r\nComposed By James Son\r\nArranged By SHAUN\r\n\r\n불안하고 불완전한 별의 조각을 맞춰주고 하나의 별이 되게 해 준 너라는 구원자에게 부르는 노래.\r\n끝은 곧 출발임을 알리는 나팔소리로 시작되는 이 곡은, 담담한 어쿠스틱 기타와 어우러지는 하프시코드 연주로 깊이를 더해간다. 특별 할 것 없지만, 마음을 건드리는 멜로디가 돋보이는 미디엄 템포의 포크 팝.\r\n\r\n14. 잘 지내\r\nLyrics By 윤하\r\nComposed By 윤하\r\nArranged By JEWNO\r\n\r\n인연의 끝은 언제나 개운 할 수만은 없지만, 그 과정에 의미가 있다.\r\n모든 날은 너와 나를 만들었고 그렇게 하루 더 성장한다.\r\n쓸쓸하지만 밝은 듯한 어쿠스틱 기타와 힘있고 락킹한 기타 사운드가 만감의 교차를 들려준다.\r\n1절의 스네어를 기점으로 과거의 프레임을 보내주는 것이 인상적", "recommend"=>"19776", "artist_id"=>"윤하 (YOUNHA)", "album_link"=>"https://cdnimg.melon.co.kr/cm2/album/images/109/03/868/10903868_20220330103544_500.jpg?e89c53bde5d39b21b09e8007db5b9cc0/melon/resize/282/quality/80/optimize"}, "commit"=>"Create Album"}
